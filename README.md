I'm an Information Systems student at BYU graduating with a bachelor's and master's degree in April 2026 and looking for the next step on my journey of tech competence and creative innovation.
I wholeheartedly beleive this popular internet proverb: “Everything is computer. ” That’s why I became a programmer: deep technological
competence is essential to understanding the world and being a capable, agentic citizen in the 21st century.
